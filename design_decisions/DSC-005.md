# DSC-0005: Macro averaging metrics

### Decision
For two of our metrics, we decided to make the macro averaging of them as precision and recall only work for 2 classes and in this project we are dealing with datasets with many features.

### Status
Accepted

### Motivation
As I do not understand many metrics, we decided to stay with the ones we are more comfortable with, however, for precision and recall we needed to make changes as they can only be used for binary features, when we are working with multiple features.

### Reason
The reason to macro average precision and recall came from knowing we couldn't use those normally as many classes could be passed, but still wanting to use metrics we know, we decided to implement these macro averages of the metric types. 

### Limitations
The limitation is that the metrics are probably not as accurate as others such as the r squared or original multi class metrics, but they do a good job and work appropriately. 

### Alternatives
The alternative would involve using a different metric type which can handle multiple classes just as mean squared error.
