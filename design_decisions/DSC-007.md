# DSC-015: st.expander 

### Decision
In order to organize the app better, we added st.expander in the development.

### Status
Accepted

### Motivation
The motivation for this decision came from the fact that we could not have all the buttons there were as they conflicted with each other and only the newest one would be visible and accessable. Therefore it was to our advantage to separate the page into two using two st.expanders.

### Reason
Without using them, the buttons collapsed and probably all merged to one same spot, so for functionality as well as style, we separated the deployment page in the app.

### Limitations
The limitation is that it took a while to format everything so that it would work well, but ultimately they improve our functionality and add good taste to the app. 

### Alternatives
As an alternative it was possible to resolve the issue of the conflicting buttons and spread them out, however this solution offers a much cleaner page for the user and less cluttered.
