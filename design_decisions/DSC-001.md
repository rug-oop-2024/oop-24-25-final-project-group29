# DSC-0001: Use pandas for feature type detection

# Decision: 
Use pandas to detect feature types in the dataset

# Status: 
Accepted

# Motivation: 
pandas provides efficient, built-in methods for determining data types, making it a natural choice for feature type detection

# Reason: 
pandas' `is_numeric_dtype` and `is_object_dtype` functions offer a simple, reliable way to detect numerical and categorical features. This reduces the need for custom type-checking logic and leverages existing, well-tested functionality.

# Limitations:
   The code assumes that there are no NaN values, which may lead to issues with real-world datasets.

# Alternatives:
   - A custom implementation for type detection, but this would likely be more error-prone and would require maintenance.
   - Use a more complex library like `sklearn`'s `ColumnTransformer`, but that would add unnecessary complexity if only basic feature type detection is needed.
