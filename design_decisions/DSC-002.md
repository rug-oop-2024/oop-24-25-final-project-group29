# DSC-0001: Wrapping sklearns models to ours

### Decision
We decided to implement all of our models as wrappers to other libraries as sklearn.

### Status
Accepted

### Motivation
This was motivated from the fact that it would make the implementations so much easier, and able to take various arguments which is useful as all the models might require different arguments to be passed. 

### Reason
The reason to implement all models as wrappers was to extend the functionality of the Sklearn's models which work appropriately and adapt them to our specific code. This makes the implementation easier, and we make sure there are no silly mistakes in the formulation of the models. 

### Limitations
The limitations to this design is that we needed models that are implemented in external libraries, but this posed no problems as they all did. Also, by not implementing the classes directly it makes them more general and less flexible to other behaviour we might want in the future.

### Alternatives
An alternative to these wrapper would be to implement the models ourselves, however this is much more efficient and works very well.
