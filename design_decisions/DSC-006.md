# DSC-0001: Predictions can be downloaded

### Date
2024-10-11

### Decision
The predictions on the app, when a pipeline is executed only shows the first 10 values as in really long datasets it could ocupy a lot of space and not be really clean. So instead we decided to have an option to download a csv of the predictions (training and testing) if the user wants to see the whole thing.

### Status
Accepted

### Motivation
What motivated us for this decision was that the values were very ugly on the screen and when trying big datasets, the tables would go on forever. 

### Reason
When we used a very big dataset we realized that our app did not really account for it and the user would have to scroll down for a long time to see all the predictions and even optionws further down. 

### Limitations
The limitation is that if there are not a lot more than the first 10 predictions and the user wants to see them they are forced to download a csv file. But they can delete it afterwards if wanted. 

### Alternatives
We could have automatically downloaded the csv file with the predictionsw when executing a pipeline or just showing the results plainly, but this option seemed like the best.
