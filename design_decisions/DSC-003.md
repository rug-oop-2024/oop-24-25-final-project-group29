# DSC-0003: Use pickle for data saving

# Decision:
Use Python’s `pickle` module for serializing and saving data.

# Status:
Accepted

# Motivation:
The `pickle` module is efficient for saving complex Python objects, such as models, lists, and dictionaries, into byte streams. 
It simplifies the process of saving and loading data without manually handling serialization formats.

# Reason:
`pickle` supports a wide variety of Python objects and is a built-in solution, making it easy to implement. 
It is a flexible tool for persisting data in scenarios where complex objects need to be saved and later restored.

# Alternatives:
- **JSON**: Could be used for simple data types (dictionaries, lists), but it doesn’t support complex Python objects like custom classes.
- **Joblib**: Useful for saving large objects, especially machine learning models. Provides better performance than `pickle` in some cases.
- **SQLite**: For persistent storage in a more structured way, but adds complexity in setup and management.

# Trade-Offs:
- **Pros**: Simple to implement and works with most Python data types.
- **Cons**: Not human-readable and can introduce security risks when deserializing untrusted data.
