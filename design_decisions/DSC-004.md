# DSC-0004: Use Global Lists for the Metric Names and Model Names

# Decision:
Metric names and model names are defined in global lists at the top of the file where they are implemented. This allows for easy reference and consistent use of metric names and model names throughout the codebase.

# Status:
Accepted

# Motivation:
By defining global lists for metric names (e.g., `REGRESSION_METRICS` and `CLASSIFICATION_METRICS`) and model names, it becomes easier to maintain and update these names in a single location. This helps reduce redundancy and the risk of inconsistencies across the code. For example, if a new metric is added or an existing one is renamed, only the global list needs to be updated.

# Reason:
This approach simplifies the management of metric and model names by centralizing them in one place. It also reduces the chance of errors from having multiple hard-coded instances of the same string in different parts of the code.

# Limitations:
   - The use of global lists might introduce a slight coupling between different parts of the code, as any change to the global list may affect multiple components.
   - As the project grows, there might be an increase in the number of global lists which can get problematic.

# Alternatives:
   - Defining constants within each class instead of using global lists would encapsulate metric names more tightly within their respective contexts. However, this may lead to repeated code and reduce the flexibility of managing them globally.

# Trade-Offs:
   - The decision is simple and effective for this project as the list of metrics and models isn't expected to grow significantly.
